# SimpleReactProjects
A collection of simple ReactJS projects using _create-react-app_.  The main purpose of this repository is to gain experience using React.
The projects will be taken from my Launch School work, so I already have working versions in straight Javascript and the DOM API.

Here is the list of Launch School Projects I am going to move to React, and their directory locations:

1.  _Number Guessing Game_: /Users/ericricketts/Documents/LaunchSchool/HTMLCSSJavascript/DOMAndAsynchronousProgrammingWithJavascript/EventDrivenAndAsynchronousProgramming/assignment_guessing_game
2.  _Simple Arithmetic Calculator_: /Users/ericricketts/Documents/LaunchSchool/HTMLCSSJavascript/DOMAndAsynchronousProgrammingWithJavascript/PuttingItAltogether/AssignmentOneArithmeticCalculator
3.  _Grocery List_: /Users/ericricketts/Documents/LaunchSchool/HTMLCSSJavascript/DOMAndAsynchronousProgrammingWithJavascript/PuttingItAltogether/AssignmentTwoGroceryList
4.  _Selection Filters_: /Users/ericricketts/Documents/LaunchSchool/exercises/Javascript/events_and_asynchronous_programming/code/exercise_six.html
5.  _Article Highlighter_: /Users/ericricketts/Documents/LaunchSchool/exercises/Javascript/events_and_asynchronous_programming/code/exercise_seven.html
6.  _Exotic Animals_: /Users/ericricketts/Documents/LaunchSchool/exercises/Javascript/miscellaneous_gui_apps/myguiapp
7.  _Programming Languages Info_: /Users/ericricketts/Documents/LaunchSchool/exercises/Javascript/miscellaneous_gui_apps/programming_languages
8.  _A Custom Delete Confirmation Prompt_: /Users/ericricketts/Documents/LaunchSchool/exercises/Javascript/miscellaneous_gui_apps/custom_delete_confirmation_prompt
9.  _A Car Shop With Filtering_: /Users/ericricketts/Documents/LaunchSchool/exercises/Javascript/miscellaneous_gui_apps/adding_smar_select_to_car_shop
10. _A Javascript Stopwatch_: /Users/ericricketts/Documents/LaunchSchool/exercises/Javascript/miscellaneous_gui_apps/a_javascript_stopwatch
11. _A Javascript Calculator_: go to the Launch School Exercises, _Miscellaneous GUI Apps_ exercise nine
12. _A Javascript WYSIWYG Editor_: go to the Launch School Exercises, _Miscellaneous GUI App_ exercise ten

Optionally consider the Launch School Exercises on From Validation, as forms are very important to business applications.

There are 5 exercises all in the following directory:
/Users/ericricketts/Documents/LaunchSchool/exercises/Javascript/forms_and_form_validation

For the above exercises you can find the descriptions at the Launch School Exercises _Forms and Form Validation_.

Do the above exercises using React classes then move them to functional components and hooks.

It would be a good idea to do simple React projects while you learn NodeJS/ExpressJS.  I have a pdf file in this directory which has 50 React projects.
The good thing about this booklet is each project as has three different levels of increasing complexity.
